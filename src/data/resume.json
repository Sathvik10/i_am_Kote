My primary focus was on Post-Fulfilment (Financials), and I played a key role in a modernization initiative that involved building a new Order Management System based on microservices architecture.\n - In this initiative, I led the modernization efforts for the invoicing service, catering to 69 million Sam's Club customers across the United States. The new system achieved a processing speed of 10,000 records per minute, significantly reducing accounting discrepancies from $44 million to $8 million. \n - Over the span of two years, I contributed to various projects, including Healer Service, Distributed ID Generator, and State Machine for Order Orchestration. In addition to my technical involvement in multiple projects, I mentored four colleagues and received a Bravo Award for exceptional time management and collaboration skills in a fast-paced environment.",

Student Form: Students input their demographic information, resume (optional), and project ranking, so that they can be scored on these factors.\n 2. Matching Process: Ranking students with appropriate projects based on criteria such as technical skills, expertise, project scope, student preferences, and sponsor restrictions/preferences. \n 3. Admin Control: Oversee the entire matching process: managing project listings, form submission timelines, handle user accounts (including student and faculty profiles), configure the matching algorithm. \n 4. Professor Dashboard: View the student's matching score for a particular project, view details of all the projects and submit projects preferences.",
